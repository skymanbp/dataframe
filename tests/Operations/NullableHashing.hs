Regression tests for null-aware row hashing and row extraction.

`Nothing` in a nullable unboxed column must be a distinct value from any
`Just x` (so @distinct@/@groupBy@/joins do not merge them), and `toRowList`
must round-trip nulls faithfully. These pin the bug surfaced by the
category-theory set-algebra laws, where @Nothing@ was stored as an
uninitialised int and collided with @Just 0@.
