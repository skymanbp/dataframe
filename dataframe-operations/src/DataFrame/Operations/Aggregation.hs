{- | Aggregate a grouped dataframe using the expressions given.
All ungrouped columns will be dropped.

NOTE: this function deliberately never pattern-matches or strictly binds the
'Grouped' per-row fields (this module is compiled with @-XStrict@, whose strict
patterns and bindings would force them): on direct-grouped frames BOTH
'valueIndices' (the placement permutation) and 'rowToGroup' are deferred
thunks, and each aggregation path needs at most one of them — always passed as
un-forced argument expressions. Key columns materialize through 'groupRepRows'
(one representative row per group) instead of gathering
@valueIndices[offsets[g]]@.

        one full pass per expression. At or below 'streamGroupCap' groups that
        pass streams over (rowToGroup, columns) with per-worker accumulators —
        never touching the (possibly lazy) valueIndices; above it (necessarily a
        hash-path grouping, whose valueIndices is already eager) the accumulator

        one traversal instead of one per expression). Only taken when at
